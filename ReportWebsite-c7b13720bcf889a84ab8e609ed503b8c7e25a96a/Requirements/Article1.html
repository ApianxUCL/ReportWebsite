				<h3>The Client Meeting</h3>
				During our meeting with Apian, we asked the finalised questions that we wrote
				prior to the meeting. We received either answers or notes for follow up. These were noted in
				the google Doc to log meetings that we created.</p>

				<h3>Answers to our previous questions</h3>
				<p>
				<h4>Who exactly is going to use the application?</h4>
				Estates & Facilities management staffwho organise, e.g.
				porters and , helideck personnel and in some cases, transport
				facilities, Laboratory staff, Pharmacy department staff
				<br>
				What are porters?
				<br>
				Porters are staff who move patients and equipment around the hospital.
				<br>

				<h4>For the web application, is it going to be used on mobiles? Should we support mobiles,
					have usable designs for them?</h4>
				Both mobile and desktop. Should be web based and PWA for mobile.
				<br>

				<h4>What BLE devices are we going to use for location tracking?</h4>
				UCL recommends Airtags; we could also use other BLE tags
				Airtags can only emit a pinging sound.
				To be confirmed and agreed upon after more research.
				<br>

				<h4>What is already done/implemented from Apian side? Mostly thinking about the
					integration of our app into the existing system.</h4>
				Nothing.
				<br>

				<h4>Regarding the SharePoint solution, if it’s gonna have an equivalent UI, what’s the
					point of A-B testing? (also note for developers, it may be worth thinking about how
					to minimize duplication/effort required to develop two separate solutions)
					<br>
				</h4>
				What criteria are going to be used to prioritise work? Who provides the information
				on it?

				<br>
				<h4>How should emergencies be handled? Eg. What should the porter do if they’re in the
					middle of a delivery? How to interrupt (or not) ongoing deliveries from technical
					and from business side?
					<br>
				</h4>
				<h4>With regards to tracking porters in a multi story building, do you already have
					a solution to this? We were thinking of using the porter’s smartphone to find out
					interior tracking and to know which floor the porters are in.
					<br>
				</h4>
				<h4>How can we track individual high priority assets and equipment? Is this within the
					scope of the Apian? The alternative would be returning equipment to storage asap
					after use and a porter to check if equipment is available in storage (slower)
					<br>
