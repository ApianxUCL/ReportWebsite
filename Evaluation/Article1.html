								<h2>Critical Evaluation</a></h2>

							<h3>User Interface</h3>
							It's important to mention that our project consists of two parts, an Android Application that scans 
							for BLE devices and a Web ApplicationThroughout the development of our project, we made sure to keep in mind that our users are medical staffs. This means that the UI/UX and workflow of the 
							overall system must be clear and straightforward. In order to achieve this, we kept close contact with our client and ask them for feedback after every design
						iteration. The client even helped us out by providing direct feedback with their respective UI/UX employee. Some key UI/UX design we've evaluated: </p>


						<ul>
							<li>The main page of the web app is the Live Monitoring Page. This is where medical staff dispatchers would most likely spend a lot of the time seeing. We made 
								sure to color code the porters on the map based on their availability. Moreover, on the table to the right of the map, we clearly show the availability status of porters
								 by color coding the cell.
							</li>
							<li>The delivery request function is also located on the Live Monitoring Page since it would make sense for users to see who are available or not and making a request based on that. </li>
							<li>With regards to navigating to other pages, it doesn't get impler as using a classic navigation bar and highlighting the page the user is seeing at present. If users want to see 
								delivery history made in the past by porters they may navigate to 
							</li>
							<li>
								With respect to our Android Application, the app is meant to be used by porters walking around the hospitals in order for medical staff to track them with the use of beacons placed around hospitals.
								Hence, the app is really simple with clear design and instruction for porters. Porters can either accept or decline a request made by the medical staff on the app. The option to accept or decline is really clear
								due to the color and the size of the button. 


							</li>
						  </ul>

						
							
							<h3>Functionalities</h3>
							<p>
								
								We've always prioritise the client's requirement of this project. All the "Must Have" that are required, we've succesfully finished and implemented. 
								here are some of them:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Create a bluetooth scanning Anroid app that scans for beacons and if it comes close to a beacon it then sends the MAC address to our web app. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Live monitor porters through the use of the Android App and beacons placed around the hospital. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Create a working web app which has the following functionalities: Live Monitoring, Delivery Logs, Send Requests to porters.
									</li>

								</ul>
								In terms of tracking porters, we ran into a bit of trouble due to the beacon's signal strength. Tracking porters with 100% accuracy would most likely need 
								multiple beacons surrounding the area at all times for the app to scan it successfully and sends the MAC Address back to our web app. This is called triangluation where we use the distance and signal strength
								provided by the three closest beacons to the porter in order to accurately locate where the porter is. We wrote the algorithm for this and proposed it to our client. Due to privacy reasons, said by the client, we had to scratch it and proposed
								a much simple solution. The current solution  is to place more beacons around the pick-up/delivery area so we are still able to keep track of which porters are closest and available for a delivery.
