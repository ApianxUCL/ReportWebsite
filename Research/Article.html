							<h3>Setting Up</h3>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/startingOut.png" alt="" /></span>
								To kick off, we arranged a meeting with all group members out of hours. We set up 
							a Microsoft Teams group, a Github repository. We set up a Google Doc to track interactions 
							with the client. Having not received the project brief from UCL, we reached out 
							directly to our client, Apian, via email to try and get a project briefing and set up a call. 
							Apian was quick to respond and set up a meeting. As we did not have the project 
							briefing, we instead used the time to try and offload work down the line by asking 
							what the TAs what deliverables there would be within the project and working on 
							them. For example, we set up the portfolio blog in the first week. Additionally, 
							we attempted to preemptively write some questions for our client without the project 
							briefing as a formative thinking task. We used the client's website as inspiration for 
							the kind of questions we would ask. These questions were noted on the Google Doc.</p>
							
							<h3>Meeting Team Members and Discussing the Brief</h3>
							<p>
								During the meeting with group members that we arranged, we discussed our experiences, 
							our strengths and our weaknesses. We talked about this in the context of what roles and 
							what work we might want to take of the project.
							</p>
							<p>
								We later received the project briefing notes, a little in advance of our initial 
							meeting with Apian, using the briefing, we further refined our questions to ask questions 
							where there were gaps in understanding of the briefing or our knowledge. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The initial project briefing we received was as follows: Healthcare drone porter 
							interface, simulating porters around a hospital with multiple building sites, and can 
							make use of AirTags, BLE devices and other ways of beacon route finding. Design a 
							front end UI that is cross platform, as well as a SharePoint solution with equivalent 
							UI to do an A-B test for comparison of results. Mimicking the UCL buildings to begin 
							with will be a good starting point. Both packages should enable a hospital to plot 
							locations of porters, and issue requests to them via Twilio, demonstrate queue and 
							prioritisation of work, and integrate with other communication services.
							</p>
							<h3>Our final questions were:</h3>
							<p>
								Who exactly is going to use the application?
								<br>
								For the web application, is it going to be used on mobiles? Should we support mobiles, 
								have usable designs for them?
								<br>
								What BLE devices are we going to use for location tracking?
								<br>
								What is already done/implemented from Apian side? Mostly thinking about the 
								integration of our app into the existing system.
								<br>
								What criteria are going to be used to prioritise work? Who provides the information 
								on it?
								<br>
								How should emergencies be handled? Eg. What should the porter do if they’re in the 
								middle of a delivery? How to interrupt (or not) ongoing deliveries from technical 
								and from business side?
								<br>
								With regards to tracking porters in a multi story building, do you already have 
								a solution to this? We were thinking of using the porter’s smartphone to find out 
								interior tracking and to know which floor the porters are in.
								<br>
								How can we track individual high priority assets and equipment? Is this within the 
								scope of the Apian? The alternative would be returning equipment to storage asap 
								after use and a porter to check if equipment is available in storage (slower)
								<br>
