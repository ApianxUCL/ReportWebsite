							<h3>Introduction</h3>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/startingOut.png" alt="" /></span>
								In order to 1. carefully consider possible features for the project to implement 2. 
							consider areas of extension 3. measure progress 4. follow the merits of existing solutions, 
							it is important that we conduct a reiview of similar existing projects.</p>

							<h3>UBI Solutions: Hospital Assets Tracking</h3>
							<p>
								UBI Solutions is a French software company primarily focussed on providing asset 
							tracking solutions. It creates a variety of solutions for corporations in the food 
							industry, laundry, retail and more. Typically solutions revolve around using RFID 
							tags and mobile or fixed readers. [1] However, other solutions are also used and the 
							company's focus is providing an effective solution tailored to a client.
							</p>
							<p>
								In this review we will look at one solution, picked among many of the projects 
							due to its similarity to the context of our own project. It was in part picked randomly
							from several similar projects, due to said projects also being similarly well documented 
							with similar merits. 
							</p>
							<p>
								UBI Solutions' Hospital Assets Tracking makes use of BLE tags and beacons to track 
							assets such as bed sheets moving throughout the hospital. They work on a gateway system 
							where BLE gateways track individual BLE tags throughout the hospital. BLE tags each have 
							unique identifiers that they transmit. In addition to tracking, the tags are fitted with 
							shock, temperature and humidity sensors where relevant to track the health of the asset.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>The main goals of the system are:</b><br>
								To free up staff time<br>
								Reducing loss of equipment due to theft<br>
								Reduce costs due to negligence<br>
								To reliably log asset usage data<br>
								Implement automatic preventative care of assets<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								The solution is effective, minimal and cost effective. It has a lot of the features 
							that we would need for a hospital porter tracking system, where instead of assets we would 
							track porters. It has some redundant features such as the sensors to detect health of the 
							asset, however the overall principle is the same. It does however miss 1. a method to 
							communicate to porters their tasks and 2. a method to decide which porters are optimal for 
							tasks. Both features missing are quite essential and something we would have to explore 
							ourselves.
							</p>

							<h3>Navenio: Hospital Staff Tracking</h3>

							<p>
								Navenio is an Oxford based company focussed on increasing ROI of hospitals. They achieve 
							this with their smartphone based location tracking and task assignment solution to assign tasks.
							They have utilize a mixture of IUD, GPS and wifi to accurately track staff locations. Further 
							to this, they utilize a task assignment system and collect logistic data with some amount of 
							automated processing to generate recommendations to increase efficiency.
							</p>
							<p>
								As mentioned, Navenio's solution utilizes IUD, GPS and wifi to accurately track staff location.
							They utilize PDR algorithms to adjust for ways a smartphone is held and deep learning based correction 
							of inertia discrepancies due to positioning of the phone. They also make use of camera data where 
							possible.GPD and wi-Fi is used to accurately detect when someone enters or exits the building. 
							The system is interestingly capable of multiple floor location and tracking. Maps of the hospital are 
							automatically built using historical tracking data of all the staff.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>The main goals of the system are:</b><br>
								To free up staff time<br>
								Optimal assignment of tasks<br>
								Provide a solution that has no dependency on installing infrastructure<br>
								To reliably log movement data for efficiency recommendations<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								The solution is effective, minimal and cost effective, installation wise. Development of the algorithms 
							and potential problems may create heavy costs however. As the solution utilizes AI to accurately location 
							track, extensive collection of phone movement data is required and will create heavy costs.
							</p>
