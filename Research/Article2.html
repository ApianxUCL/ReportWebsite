								<h2>Market Research</a></h2>

								Following the client meeting, we wrote up requirements, which can be seen in the requirements
								section of the portfolio blog. In an attempt to try and refine our requirements further 
								we conducted market research. Having set up the relevant communication channels with 
								Apian such as Slack, WhatsApp and Email, we tried to confirm a tech stack with our client. 
								This involved investigating the pricings, discussing budgets and caveats with different 
								technologies and their competitors.
							<p>
								Knowing our client was working on a small budget, being a startup, we took a greater 
								focus on budget options for Bluetooth tracking and communication. For instance, we asked 
								the Computer Science help desk what BLE tracking devices they had available to help 
								direct our choices. Furthermore, we explored funding options from UCL, discussing and 
								writing emails to ask what UCL would be willing to fund. For example if UCL could fund a 
								premium firebase subscription.
							</p>
							<p>
								The potential tracking options we considered were, low power BLE beacons which many 
								companies sold. Options we saw included Aruba, Zebra, Moko Smart and many others. 
								We considered GPS, however we knew this might not be feasible for hospitals with 
								many floors especially in the basement for example, so it was decided that this 
								would be a last option. We also considered using bluetooth and GPS in combination 
								for more accurate tracking. 
								<br>
								At this stage, we could already foresee problems arising. For example, a group member who 
								had prior experience with bluetooth suggested that bluetooth may not be extremely accurate 
								due signal interferences and obstacles blocking signal such as a phone case, and walls, 
								particularly as many doors in hospitals are thick fire doors. 
							</p>
							<p>
								We knew that we would likely have to implement a mobile app for porters and a website for 
								administrators in the system. From discussing with Apian we knew that this was usually 
								specific people who assigned tasks to porters but could also be doctors themselves. 
								<br>
								From this we could tell that we needed to decide on a frontend framework, how to implement 
								the app and how to store data in the backend. Hosting would also need to be handled. 
								As we knew that we were using several different platforms (mobile and web) we immediately 
								knew that React Native was a safe bet due to its performant and cross platform nature. 
								Some of our members also had experience with React Native making it an excellent choice. 
								After discussion we felt that React native would also be a viable option for the mobile app 
								but soon realized the levels of permissions that would be needed would warrant an application 
								and a webpage would not suffice. 
								<br>
								Our client, Apian who had experience in the area also guided us to use create an Android app. 
								We decided that the app would be best written in Kotlin.
