					<h2>Client Consultation</a></h2>

				<h3>The Client Meeting</h3>
				During our meeting with Apian, we asked the finalised questions that we wrote
				prior to the meeting. We received either answers or notes for follow up. These were noted in
				the google Doc to log meetings that we created.</p>

				<h3>Answers to our previous questions</h3>
				<p>
				<h4>Who exactly is going to use the application?</h4>
				Estates & Facilities management staffwho organise, e.g.
				porters and , helideck personnel and in some cases, transport
				facilities, Laboratory staff, Pharmacy department staff
				<br>
				What are porters?
				<br>
				Porters are staff who move patients and equipment around the hospital.
				<br>

				<h4>For the web application, is it going to be used on mobiles? Should we support mobiles,
					have usable designs for them?</h4>
				Both mobile and desktop. Should be web based and PWA for mobile.
				<br>

				<h4>What BLE devices are we going to use for location tracking?</h4>
				UCL recommends Airtags; we could also use other BLE tags
				Airtags can only emit a pinging sound.
				To be confirmed and agreed upon after more research.
				<br>

				<h4>What is already done/implemented from Apian side? Mostly thinking about the
					integration of our app into the existing system.</h4>
				Nothing.
				<br>
				<h4>
					What criteria are going to be used to prioritise work? Who provides the information
					on it?</h4>
				<p></p>
				Further research is needed to determine how porter workload is currently prioritised.
				A crash call that requires a porter to get blood packs for transfusion will always
				take priority above anything else.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prioritisation criteria will be determined by medical need, incorporating:
					If sample is labelled as urgent or not by the clinician, required turnaround time
					e.g. renal samples need to be delivered to a lab by 2pm to ensure same day results
					vs another sample that can wait for next day delivery, time-related payload
					constraints e.g. an item needs to be temperature controlled and the packaging
					only can keep it at a certain temperature for X hrs so must be delivered before
					the cold chain is breached.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then we can add other layers such as: Prioritisation between samples and other
					porter work, Travelling salesperson problem - should a lower priority item be
					collected on the way to a higher priority item if timing is not significantly
					affected?
					<br>
					Capacity of the drone (a lower priority item may fit in the next incoming
					drone while a more urgent item can only fit in an empty drone that’s coming
					in next) - this implies higher volume
				</p>
				<h4>How should emergencies be handled? Eg. What should the porter do if they’re in the
					middle of a delivery? How to interrupt (or not) ongoing deliveries from technical
					and from business side?
				</h4>
				Further research is needed
				<br>
				<h4>With regards to tracking porters in a multi story building, do you already have
					a solution to this? We were thinking of using the porter’s smartphone to find out
					interior tracking and to know which floor the porters are in.
				</h4>
				Further research is needed. Porters don’t carry work liable smartphones.
				<br>
				<h4>How can we track individual high priority assets and equipment? Is this within the
					scope of the Apian? The alternative would be returning equipment to storage asap
					after use and a porter to check if equipment is available in storage (slower)
				</h4>
				Out of scope
