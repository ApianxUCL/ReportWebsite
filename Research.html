									<h3>Related Projects and Hardware Review</h3>
									<p>
										Our task consists of creating a hospital porter tracking solution in order to increase 
										the efficiency of porters within hospitals. In particular and contrary to other past 
										projects, our solution focusses on tracking porters and setting them tasks in order to 
										best coordinate delivery of medical freight using drones. This comes with the associated 
										problems of timing porters based on drone arrival times.
									</p>
									<p>
										It is important to review existing projects so that one may bring forward their merits in 
										our solution. Additionally, by reviewing existing solutions, not only can we learn from the 
										merits, we may also learn from any shortcomings and flaws with regard to previous projects.
									</p>
								
									<h4>UBI Solutions</h4>
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/UBI Solutions.PNG" alt=""/>
									<p>
										UBI Solutions is a French software company primarily focussed on providing asset
										tracking solutions. It creates a variety of solutions for corporations in the food
										industry, laundry, retail and more. Typically solutions revolve around using RFID
										tags and mobile or fixed readers. <sub>[]</sub> However, other solutions are also used and the
										company's focus is providing an effective solution tailored to a client.
									</p>
									<p>
										In this review we will look at one solution, picked among many of their projects
										due to its similarity to the context of our own project. It was in part picked randomly
										from several similar projects, due to said projects also being similarly well documented
										with similar merits. <sub>[]</sub>
									</p>
									<p>
										UBI Solutions' Hospital Assets Tracking makes use of BLE tags and beacons to track
										assets such as bed sheets moving throughout the hospital. They work on a gateway system
										where BLE gateways track individual BLE tags throughout the hospital. BLE tags each have
										unique identifiers that they transmit. In addition to tracking, the tags are fitted with
										shock, temperature and humidity sensors where relevant to track the health of the asset
										<sub>[]</sub>.

									</p>
									<h4>Goals of the Solution</h4>
									<p>
										<b>The main goals of the system are:</b><br>
										To free up staff time<br>
										Reducing loss of equipment due to theft<br>
										Reduce costs due to negligence<br>
										To reliably log asset usage data<br>
										Implement automatic preventative care of assets<br>
									</p>
									<h4>Effectiveness of the Solution</h4>
									<p>
										The solution is effective, minimal and cost effective. It has a lot of the features
										that we would need for a hospital porter tracking system, where instead of assets we would
										track porters. It has some redundant features such as the sensors to detect health of the
										asset, however the overall principle is the same. It does however miss 1. a method to
										communicate to porters their tasks and 2. a method to decide which porters are optimal for
										tasks. Both features missing are quite essential and something we would have to explore
										ourselves.
									</p>
									<h4>RFID and NFC Tags</h4>
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/RFID.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>
									<p>
										More notably, we see that UBI Solutions has picked BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tags instead of alternatives such 
										as RFID(Radio-Frequency Identification) tags and NFC(Near Field Communication) tags. BLE tags have much further range of detection than RFID tags <sub>[]</sub>. 
										This enables better tracking of assets which we may not be able to scan individually due to their high 
										number. For our project problem, hospital porters will often be in a hurry and may be stressed.
										In addition, hospital porters typically will not be used to scanning a tag whenever they walk 
										past checkpoints. In hospitals, there is not time for error and mistake due to needing time 
										to form a habit. As such, we similarly regard RFID tags as an inappropriate solution due to 
										high potential for mistakes. This is quite different to UBI Solutions who most likely picked 
										BLE beacons due to their concern for security.
									</p>
									<h4>Discussion on Merits and Pitfalls of NFC tags</h4>
									<p>
										NFC tags which UBI Solutions has used for other projects, and likely also considered for 
										their hospital asset tracking solution are also inappropriate for our project due to the 
										reasons outlined above. They are also only effective at short ranges. 
									</p>
									<h4>BLE Tags</h4>
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/BLE.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>
									<p>
										One might also be concerned that many BLE, RFID and NFC tags are not able to perform two way 
										communication. From our requirements, we need the hospital 
										porters to be able to reject tasks and set their busy status. This is for the sake of both porter 
										information privacy, breaks and in case they are busy with other tasks that are set without the 
										system, i.e. a Doctor directly asks a porter.
										However, it should be noted that in our solution, the tags will not be performing the communication. 
										The tags will serve as markers of positions in the hospital and smartphones which pick up on their 
										mac addresses will then post these addresses as location dater to the web server.
									</p>
									<h4>Discussion on Merits and Pitfalls of BLE</h4>
									<p>
										Further research on BLE beacons not only determines that they are typically long reaching enough 
										and strong enough signal for the purposes of our project, but that they, like the name implies, are 
										low energy and low maintenance <sub>[]</sub>. They would minimally add to the operating costs of the hospital 
										and are not likely to break. They are also extremely cheap and having many of these dotted around a 
										hospital should not pose a problem with expenses. BLE beacons do however need to be installed 
										and require careful planning.
									</p>

									<h4>Navenio: Hospital Staff Tracking</h4>
									
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/navenio.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>
									<p>
										Navenio is an Oxford based company focussed on increasing ROI of hospitals. They achieve
										this with their smartphone based location tracking and task assignment solution to assign tasks.
										They have utilize a mixture of IMU (inertial measurement unit), GPS and wifi to accurately track staff locations. Further
										to this, they utilize a task assignment system and collect logistic data with some amount of
										automated processing to generate recommendations to increase efficiency.
									</p>
									<p>
										As mentioned, Navenio's solution utilizes IMU, GPS and wifi to accurately track staff location.
										They utilize PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) algorithms to adjust for ways a smartphone is held and deep learning based
										correction
										of inertia discrepancies due to positioning of the phone. They also make use of camera data where
										possible.GPD and wi-Fi is used to accurately detect when someone enters or exits the building.
										The system is interestingly capable of multiple floor location and tracking. Maps of the hospital
										are
										automatically built using historical tracking data of all the staff. 										
									</p>
									<h4>Goals of the Solution</h4>
									<p>
										<b>The main goals of the system are:</b><br>
										To free up staff time<br>
										Optimal assignment of tasks<br>
										Provide a solution that has no dependency on installing infrastructure<br>
										To reliably log movement data for efficiency recommendations<br>
									</p>
									<h4>Effectiveness of the Solution</h4>
									<p>
										The solution is effective, minimal and cost efficient, installation wise. 
										Development of the
										algorithms
										and potential problems may create heavy costs however. As the solution utilizes 
										AI to accurately
										location
										track, extensive collection of phone movement data is required and will 
										create heavy costs.
									</p>
									<p>
										
										To pick the right technology, 
										for our solution, we further research these technologies navenio uses and 
										weigh their pros and cons.
									</p>
									<h4>Inertial Measurement Unit</h4>
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/IMU.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>

									<p>
										Navenio's use of IMU tracks the directional movement of a phone through the 
										hospital. IMU stands for Inertial Measurement Unit, which is a device that 
										measures the orientation, velocity, and acceleration of an object. IMUs are 
										commonly used in various applications, including aerospace, robotics, and 
										navigation systems <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										An IMU typically contains a set of sensors, such as accelerometers and 
										gyroscopes, which measure linear acceleration and angular velocity, 
										respectively <sub>[]</sub>. Some advanced IMUs may also include 
										magnetometers and barometers, which can measure magnetic fields and 
										atmospheric pressure, respectively <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										The IMU uses the data from these sensors to calculate the object's 
										position, velocity, and orientation. The accelerometer measures the 
										linear acceleration in three dimensions, which is then integrated to 
										obtain velocity and position. The gyroscope measures angular velocity, 
										which is also integrated to obtain the object's orientation.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, IMUs are not perfect, and there are some common sources 
										of error that can affect the accuracy of the measurements. For 
										example, the accelerometer can be affected by vibrations or shocks 
										<sub>[]</sub>, while the gyroscope may drift over time due to 
										temperature changes or manufacturing imperfections <sub>[]</sub>. 
										To mitigate these errors, IMUs may include algorithms that can filter 
										out noise or use other sensors, such as magnetometers, to correct for 
										drift <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<h4>Discussion on Merits and Pitfalls of IMU</h4>
									<p>
										IMUs can track location data and movement with extremely 
										low latency, compared to other potential 
										tracking methods. This is likely why navenio has 
										integrated them for their tracking solution. However 
										IMUs are by no means a reliable technology for location 
										tracking on their own, due to their frequent need for calibration, 
										but more importantly the huge variation in their 
										quality between phones. If we cannot be 
										reliably certain of a phone's accuracy with regard 
										to its location over time, we cannot 
										use this technology on its own. Navenio 
										utilizes this technology in combination with many other 
										technologies to gauge error and correct this, in 
										particular they cite using PDR algorithms, however 
										due to both the costs that developing such algorithms 
										would entail, our client's budget and 
										the length of the project, this approach is not feasible.
									</p>

									<h4>Global Positioning System</h4>

									<p>
										GPS stands for Global Positioning System, which is 
										a satellite-based navigation system used to 
										determine the precise location of a receiver 
										on the Earth's surface. The GPS system consists 
										of a network of about 30 satellites orbiting the 
										Earth, ground control stations, and GPS receivers.
									</p>
									<p>
										A GPS receiver receives signals from multiple GPS 
										satellites, which transmit radio signals containing 
										information about their location and time <sub>[]</sub>. 
										The GPS receiver uses this information to calculate 
										its own location, based on the time it takes for the 
										signals to reach the receiver <sub>[]</sub>. This mechanism 
										is 
										shown in the diagram below:
									</p>

									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/GPS.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>

									<p>
										To determine its position, the GPS receiver needs to 
										receive signals from at least four GPS satellites. 
										The receiver measures the time it takes for each signal 
										to travel from the satellite to the receiver. Using 
										the time difference between the arrival of signals 
										from multiple satellites, the GPS receiver can 
										determine its distance from each satellite, and 
										thus its position on the Earth's surface <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										The GPS system also takes into account the effect of 
										the Earth's atmosphere on the radio signals. The 
										atmosphere can cause the signals to be delayed or 
										distorted, which can affect the accuracy of the GPS 
										measurements. To correct for this, the GPS system 
										uses a technique called differential GPS, which compares 
										the GPS measurements from a stationary GPS receiver 
										at a known location to those from a mobile receiver 
										to determine the atmospheric effects and remove them 
										from the calculations <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<h4>Discussion on GPS Merits and Pitfalls</h4>
									<p>
										While GPS is generally effective at determining 
										position, even in buildings with considerable obstacles, 
										it struggles in several ways. GPS becomes more 
										and more inaccurate when obstructed, and would not be 
										suitable for a building with many thick firedoors, 
										several floors and large metal devices to obstruct 
										signal further, i.e. a hospital. The nature of how 
										GPS functions also means that it is slow to update 
										and this is not ideal for hospitals where time can 
										be so critical and errors matter so much. As 
										mentioned before, due to these flaws, Navenio likely 
										integrates their other technologies, however, 
										integrating so many technologies is out of the scope 
										of this project due to the cost of development 
										and low budget of our client.
									</p>

									<h3>Conclusion of Our Hardware Review</h3>
									<p>After reviewing the solutions of Navenio and UBI Solutions, 
										we conducted some further research to look for potential hardware 
										which may be feasible for our project requirements. Upon finding 
										that the hardware solutions that navenio and UBI used were indeed 
										the best and most cost effective, we began to eliminate and decide 
										which hardware tracking solution would be core to our project.
									</p>
									<p>
										The conclusion of our discussion was that we were to use BLE beacons.
										Other tracking solutions had high latency (GPS), required regular maintenance 
										and was too difficult and costly to develop (IMU). BLE beacons on the other hand 
										were cheap and effective, the only draw back being that infrastructure would have 
										to be put in place in a hospital for it to work. However, upon discussion with 
										our client, Apian, they agreed that this would not be a big problem and supported 
										our choice.

									<h3>Software Review</h3>
									<img src="images/placeholder.png" alt="" />
									<p>
										In the realm of software development, selecting the appropriate 
										technology stack is vital for developing scalable and successful applications.
										As a result, it is vital that we conduct market research. 
										Furthermore, it is important that we confirm a tech stack with our client 
										due to pricings and their own expertises being important to smooth handover of 
										the project. Due to how diverse and extensive current frameworks are, it would 
										not be conducive to discuss and compare them all as we did above for existing 
										similar solutions, of which there are not many. As a result, in the following 
										section, we will first discuss our research process then provide a general 
										comparison against typical frameworks. This will take the form of justification 
										of why we have chosen our tech stack.
									</p>

									<h4>Research Process</h4>

									<p>
										When researching technologies, API frameworks etc. to develop with, it is hard to 
										know where to start. It is hard to know if one has even chosen the correct one and 
										perhaps they should have chosen some obscure specialised technology 
										with very users. As such, we acknowledge this and realize that to some extent we 
										must settle on technologies when we have found technologies that are sufficiently 
										specialised. Further to this, we also decide to prioritize widely used technologies 
										for two reasons: 1. A larger coding eco system means more packages to use, more design 
										patterns have been realized and more debugging tutorials. 2. A more widely used technology 
										translates to smoother handover of the project to our client when the project is finished. 
										Typically more widely used technologies are better documented and further to this will 
										be more likely to be used and known by employees at our client company.
									</p>

									<h4>React</h4>

									<p>Our team decided to build a frontend for our 
										application using the React JavaScript framework. 
										React is a widely-used open-source JavaScript library 
										that facilitates the creation of user interfaces (UI) 
										by breaking down complex UI elements into smaller, 
										reusable components <sub>[]</sub>. React's virtual DOM efficiently 
										updates the UI, ensuring a seamless user experience. 
										It also allows developers to customize their projects 
										by integrating third-party libraries, which can speed 
										up development time <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										There were several reasons why we opted for React. 
										Firstly, it's a powerful tool for developing complex 
										applications that require multiple UI elements and 
										interactions. Moreover, React's use of components 
										makes it easier to reuse code and maintain consistency 
										across the application.
									</p>
									<p>
										Another significant advantage of React is its 
										well-documented and supportive community of 
										developers. We have a vast array of resources 
										available to us when we face any challenges or 
										need to add new features.
									</p>
									<p>
										For our application, we require instant updates about 
										a porter's location and any delivery responses. 
										To accomplish this, we can use websockets, a technology 
										that enables real-time communication between a 
										client and a server <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Websockets allow us to receive updates from the 
										server without making frequent requests for new 
										data, which not only reduces server load but also 
										improves the overall user experience by providing 
										real-time information. We can use the 
										'react-stomp' library to connect to the server. 
										And use the event listeners feature for incoming data 
										and updating the UI when the 
										server sent new information <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										React's ability to create complex UI elements 
										using reusable components and its large community 
										of developers make it an excellent choice for 
										building frontend applications. Additionally, 
										the use of websockets allows for real-time communication 
										and reduces server load, ultimately enhancing 
										the user experience.
									</p>

									<h4>Firebase</h4>

									<p>
										Besides utilizing React and websockets, we host our 
										application using Firebase. Firebase provides a simple 
										and reliable way to host web applications and offers 
										several useful features, such as authentication and cloud storage <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Firebase's hosting service provides automatic scaling, 
										which enables our application to handle traffic spikes without 
										any additional configuration <sub>[]</sub>. This feature is crucial to ensure 
										that our application is always available, even during peak usage.
									</p>
									<p>Finally, our client features a team with several ex-googlers. 
										While there may be many other alternatives to Firebase, 
										our client's familiarity with Firebase led to our final decision in 
										hopes that we could ease project handover.
									</p>

									<h4>Spring Boot Framework</h4>
									
									<p>
										We chose to create our backend service using Spring Boot framework, 
										Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL database, and deployed our application 
										with Google Cloud Run.
										Spring Boot is a well-known open-source Java framework that allows 
										developers to quickly build and deploy standalone, production-grade 
										applications <sub>[]</sub>. Its pre-configured libraries and tools are designed to 
										simplify the development process for building web applications. 
										Spring Boot is frequently used with React and as a result has plenty 
										of examples of use and debugging tutorials.
										We chose Spring Boot for its simplicity and ease of use, 
										as well as its extensive documentation and community support, which 
										made it an excellent choice for developing our backend services.
									</p>

									<h4>Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL</h4>
									<p>
										For our database, we selected Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL. 
										PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management 
										system known for its scalability, reliability, and extensibility. 
										Google Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service 
										that simplifies the setup, maintenance, and administration of 
										PostgreSQL databases on the Google Cloud Platform <sub>[]</sub>. Google Cloud 
										SQL PostgreSQL offers several useful features, such as automatic 
										backups, replication, and high availability, which ensure the 
										security and availability of our application's data. The integration 
										with the Google Cloud Platform also makes scaling and maintenance 
										of our database a breeze, making it ideal for handling large 
										amounts of data <sub>[]</sub>. Additionally, it is once more, Google API and 
										as mentioned before, Apian features several ex-googlers.
									</p>

									<h4>Google Cloud Run</h4>

									<p>
										To deploy our application, we decided to use Google Cloud Run, 
										a serverless computer platform that enables developers to run 
										containers in a fully managed environment. Cloud Run abstracts 
										away the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to 
										concentrate on writing code rather than managing servers <sub>[]</sub>. 
										Automatic scaling is provided by Google Cloud Run, which ensures 
										that our application can handle traffic spikes without the need 
										for additional configuration. This is critical for ensuring that 
										our backend service is always responsive, even during peak usage.
									</p>


									<h4>Porter Communication</h4>
									<p>
										We choose to utilize various APIs and services, such as Twilio for sending 
										SMS messages and Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications, 
										to achieve this.
									</p>
									<p>We chose Twilio due to its popular use and large size compared to 
										other providers. Their popularity ensures that there is plenty of example 
										code and debugging examples. Their large size ensures that Twilio is able 
										to provide reliable consistent services <sub>[]</sub>. Additionally, due to their 
										Twilio being supported internationally <sub>[]</sub>, should our client ever seek to 
										break into other markets abroad with our produt, Twilio will ease this process.
									</p>

									<h4>Kotlin Android Development</h4>
									<p>
										We chose Kotlin as our programming 
										language of choice, which has become increasingly popular for 
										Android app development <sub>[]</sub>. Kotlin is a modern statically-typed 
										language that aims to improve the efficiency and reliability 
										of Android app development. Its ability to interoperate with 
										Java <sub>[]</sub> made it a natural fit for our system, as we could utilize 
										existing Java libraries, such as Bluetooth Low Energy and Firebase, 
										while benefiting from Kotlin's unique features, such as extension 
										functions and coroutines . Since our mobile app required frequent 
										HTTP requests to our backend API endpoint, we relied heavily on 
										Kotlin's coroutine features and HTTP classes to implement 
										multithreading capabilities. This allowed our application to 
										execute multiple HTTP requests simultaneously when necessary, 
										enabling faster and more efficient performance.
									</p>
									<p>
										We chose android over other potential mobile app operating 
										Systems, due to it being one of our Client's requests. They 
										specifically requested use of android over options such as react-native 
										due to their familiarity with android.
									</p>
									
									<h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>
									<p>
										In conclusion, by using Spring Boot, Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL, 
										and deploying our application with Google Cloud Run, we can 
										design a reliable and scalable backend service. Spring Boot's 
										simplicity and ease of use allows us to quickly build and deploy 
										our application, while Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL and Google 
										Cloud Run provides us with a scalable and dependable infrastructure 
										for our database and backend services. With these technologies, 
										we can create a robust backend service that handles updates 
										from the mobile app, sent notifications to the porters, and 
										updated the UI in real-time. Automatic scaling ensures that our
