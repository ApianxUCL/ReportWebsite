									<h3>Related Projects Review</h3>
									<p>
										Our task consists of creating a hospital porter tracking solution in order to increase 
										the efficiency of porters within hospitals. In particular and contrary to other past 
										projects, our solution focusses on tracking porters and setting them tasks in order to 
										best coordinate delivery of medical freight using drones. This comes with the associated 
										problems of timing porters based on drone arrival times.
									</p>
									<p>
										It is important to review existing projects so that one may bring forward their merits in 
										our solution. Additionally, by reviewing existing solutions, not only can we learn from the 
										merits, we may also learn from any shortcomings and flaws with regard to previous projects.
									</p>
								
									<h4>UBI Solutions</h4>
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/UBI Solutions.PNG" alt=""/>
									<p>
										UBI Solutions is a French software company primarily focussed on providing asset
										tracking solutions. It creates a variety of solutions for corporations in the food
										industry, laundry, retail and more. Typically solutions revolve around using RFID
										tags and mobile or fixed readers. <sub>[]</sub> However, other solutions are also used and the
										company's focus is providing an effective solution tailored to a client.
									</p>
									<p>
										In this review we will look at one solution, picked among many of their projects
										due to its similarity to the context of our own project. It was in part picked randomly
										from several similar projects, due to said projects also being similarly well documented
										with similar merits. <sub>[]</sub>
									</p>
									<p>
										UBI Solutions' Hospital Assets Tracking makes use of BLE tags and beacons to track
										assets such as bed sheets moving throughout the hospital. They work on a gateway system
										where BLE gateways track individual BLE tags throughout the hospital. BLE tags each have
										unique identifiers that they transmit. In addition to tracking, the tags are fitted with
										shock, temperature and humidity sensors where relevant to track the health of the asset
										<sub>[]</sub>.

									</p>
									<h4>Goals of the Solution</h4>
									<p>
										<b>The main goals of the system are:</b><br>
										To free up staff time<br>
										Reducing loss of equipment due to theft<br>
										Reduce costs due to negligence<br>
										To reliably log asset usage data<br>
										Implement automatic preventative care of assets<br>
									</p>
									<h4>Effectiveness of the Solution</h4>
									<p>
										The solution is effective, minimal and cost effective. It has a lot of the features
										that we would need for a hospital porter tracking system, where instead of assets we would
										track porters. It has some redundant features such as the sensors to detect health of the
										asset, however the overall principle is the same. It does however miss 1. a method to
										communicate to porters their tasks and 2. a method to decide which porters are optimal for
										tasks. Both features missing are quite essential and something we would have to explore
										ourselves.
									</p>
									<h4>RFID and NFC Tags</h4>
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/RFID.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>
									<p>
										More notably, we see that UBI Solutions has picked BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tags instead of alternatives such 
										as RFID(Radio-Frequency Identification) tags and NFC(Near Field Communication) tags. BLE tags have much further range of detection than RFID tags <sub>[]</sub>. 
										This enables better tracking of assets which we may not be able to scan individually due to their high 
										number. For our project problem, hospital porters will often be in a hurry and may be stressed.
										In addition, hospital porters typically will not be used to scanning a tag whenever they walk 
										past checkpoints. In hospitals, there is not time for error and mistake due to needing time 
										to form a habit. As such, we similarly regard RFID tags as an inappropriate solution due to 
										high potential for mistakes. This is quite different to UBI Solutions who most likely picked 
										BLE beacons due to their concern for security.
									</p>
									<h4>Discussion on Merits and Pitfalls of NFC tags</h4>
									<p>
										NFC tags which UBI Solutions has used for other projects, and likely also considered for 
										their hospital asset tracking solution are also inappropriate for our project due to the 
										reasons outlined above. They are also only effective at short ranges. 
									</p>
									<h4>BLE Tags</h4>
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/BLE.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>
									<p>
										One might also be concerned that many BLE, RFID and NFC tags are not able to perform two way 
										communication. From our requirements, we need the hospital 
										porters to be able to reject tasks and set their busy status. This is for the sake of both porter 
										information privacy, breaks and in case they are busy with other tasks that are set without the 
										system, i.e. a Doctor directly asks a porter.
										However, it should be noted that in our solution, the tags will not be performing the communication. 
										The tags will serve as markers of positions in the hospital and smartphones which pick up on their 
										mac addresses will then post these addresses as location dater to the web server.
									</p>
									<h4>Discussion on Merits and Pitfalls of BLE</h4>
									<p>
										Further research on BLE beacons not only determines that they are typically long reaching enough 
										and strong enough signal for the purposes of our project, but that they, like the name implies, are 
										low energy and low maintenance <sub>[]</sub>. They would minimally add to the operating costs of the hospital 
										and are not likely to break. They are also extremely cheap and having many of these dotted around a 
										hospital should not pose a problem with expenses. BLE beacons do however need to be installed 
										and require careful planning.
									</p>

									<h4>Navenio: Hospital Staff Tracking</h4>
									
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/navenio.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>
									<p>
										Navenio is an Oxford based company focussed on increasing ROI of hospitals. They achieve
										this with their smartphone based location tracking and task assignment solution to assign tasks.
										They have utilize a mixture of IMU (inertial measurement unit), GPS and wifi to accurately track staff locations. Further
										to this, they utilize a task assignment system and collect logistic data with some amount of
										automated processing to generate recommendations to increase efficiency.
									</p>
									<p>
										As mentioned, Navenio's solution utilizes IMU, GPS and wifi to accurately track staff location.
										They utilize PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) algorithms to adjust for ways a smartphone is held and deep learning based
										correction
										of inertia discrepancies due to positioning of the phone. They also make use of camera data where
										possible.GPD and wi-Fi is used to accurately detect when someone enters or exits the building.
										The system is interestingly capable of multiple floor location and tracking. Maps of the hospital
										are
										automatically built using historical tracking data of all the staff. 										
									</p>
									<h4>Goals of the Solution</h4>
									<p>
										<b>The main goals of the system are:</b><br>
										To free up staff time<br>
										Optimal assignment of tasks<br>
										Provide a solution that has no dependency on installing infrastructure<br>
										To reliably log movement data for efficiency recommendations<br>
									</p>
									<h4>Effectiveness of the Solution</h4>
									<p>
										The solution is effective, minimal and cost efficient, installation wise. 
										Development of the
										algorithms
										and potential problems may create heavy costs however. As the solution utilizes 
										AI to accurately
										location
										track, extensive collection of phone movement data is required and will 
										create heavy costs.
									</p>
									<p>
										
										To pick the right technology, 
										for our solution, we further research these technologies navenio uses and 
										weigh their pros and cons.
									</p>
									<h4>Inertial Measurement Unit</h4>
									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/IMU.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>

									<p>
										Navenio's use of IMU tracks the directional movement of a phone through the 
										hospital. IMU stands for Inertial Measurement Unit, which is a device that 
										measures the orientation, velocity, and acceleration of an object. IMUs are 
										commonly used in various applications, including aerospace, robotics, and 
										navigation systems <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										An IMU typically contains a set of sensors, such as accelerometers and 
										gyroscopes, which measure linear acceleration and angular velocity, 
										respectively <sub>[]</sub>. Some advanced IMUs may also include 
										magnetometers and barometers, which can measure magnetic fields and 
										atmospheric pressure, respectively <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										The IMU uses the data from these sensors to calculate the object's 
										position, velocity, and orientation. The accelerometer measures the 
										linear acceleration in three dimensions, which is then integrated to 
										obtain velocity and position. The gyroscope measures angular velocity, 
										which is also integrated to obtain the object's orientation.
									</p>
									<p>
										However, IMUs are not perfect, and there are some common sources 
										of error that can affect the accuracy of the measurements. For 
										example, the accelerometer can be affected by vibrations or shocks 
										<sub>[]</sub>, while the gyroscope may drift over time due to 
										temperature changes or manufacturing imperfections <sub>[]</sub>. 
										To mitigate these errors, IMUs may include algorithms that can filter 
										out noise or use other sensors, such as magnetometers, to correct for 
										drift <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<h4>Discussion on Merits and Pitfalls of IMU</h4>
									<p>
										IMUs can track location data and movement with extremely 
										low latency, compared to other potential 
										tracking methods. This is likely why navenio has 
										integrated them for their tracking solution. However 
										IMUs are by no means a reliable technology for location 
										tracking on their own, due to their frequent need for calibration, 
										but more importantly the huge variation in their 
										quality between phones. If we cannot be 
										reliably certain of a phone's accuracy with regard 
										to its location over time, we cannot 
										use this technology on its own. Navenio 
										utilizes this technology in combination with many other 
										technologies to gauge error and correct this, in 
										particular they cite using PDR algorithms, however 
										due to both the costs that developing such algorithms 
										would entail, our client's budget and 
										the length of the project, this approach is not feasible.
									</p>

									<h4>Global Positioning System</h4>

									<p>
										GPS stands for Global Positioning System, which is 
										a satellite-based navigation system used to 
										determine the precise location of a receiver 
										on the Earth's surface. The GPS system consists 
										of a network of about 30 satellites orbiting the 
										Earth, ground control stations, and GPS receivers.
									</p>
									<p>
										A GPS receiver receives signals from multiple GPS 
										satellites, which transmit radio signals containing 
										information about their location and time <sub>[]</sub>. 
										The GPS receiver uses this information to calculate 
										its own location, based on the time it takes for the 
										signals to reach the receiver <sub>[]</sub>. This mechanism 
										is 
										shown in the diagram below:
									</p>

									<span class="image fit main bottom"><img src="images/GPS.PNG" alt="" class="iterationBg"/>

									<p>
										To determine its position, the GPS receiver needs to 
										receive signals from at least four GPS satellites. 
										The receiver measures the time it takes for each signal 
										to travel from the satellite to the receiver. Using 
										the time difference between the arrival of signals 
										from multiple satellites, the GPS receiver can 
										determine its distance from each satellite, and 
										thus its position on the Earth's surface <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<p>
										The GPS system also takes into account the effect of 
										the Earth's atmosphere on the radio signals. The 
										atmosphere can cause the signals to be delayed or 
										distorted, which can affect the accuracy of the GPS 
										measurements. To correct for this, the GPS system 
										uses a technique called differential GPS, which compares 
										the GPS measurements from a stationary GPS receiver 
										at a known location to those from a mobile receiver 
										to determine the atmospheric effects and remove them 
										from the calculations <sub>[]</sub>.
									</p>
									<h4>Discussion on GPS Merits and Pitfalls</h4>
									<p>
										While GPS is generally effective at determining 
										position, even in buildings with considerable obstacles, 
										it struggles in several ways. GPS becomes more 
										and more inaccurate when obstructed, and would not be 
										suitable for a building with many thick firedoors, 
										several floors and large metal devices to obstruct 
										signal further, i.e. a hospital. The nature of how 
										GPS functions also means that it is slow to update 
										and this is not ideal for hospitals where time can 
										be so critical and errors matter so much. As 
										mentioned before, due to these flaws, Navenio likely 
										integrates their other technologies, however, 
										integrating so many technologies is out of the scope 
										of this project due to the cost of development 
										and low budget of our client.

									<h3>Technology Review</h3>
									<img src="images/placeholder.png" alt="" />
									<p>
										Following the client meeting, we wrote up requirements, 
										which can be seen in the requirements
										section of the portfolio blog. In an attempt 
										to try and refine our requirements further, 
										we conducted market research. Having set up 
										the relevant communication channels with
										Apian such as Slack, WhatsApp and Email, we 
										tried to confirm a tech stack with our client.
										This involved investigating the pricings, discussing 
										budgets and caveats with different
										technologies and their competitors.
									</p>
									<p>
										Knowing our client was working on a small budget, being a startup, we took a greater
										focus on budget options for Bluetooth tracking and communication. For instance, we asked
										the Computer Science help desk what BLE tracking devices they had available to help
										direct our choices. Furthermore, we explored funding options from UCL, discussing and
										writing emails to ask what UCL would be willing to fund. For example if UCL could fund a
										premium firebase subscription.
									</p>
									<p>
										The potential tracking options we considered after were, low power BLE beacons which many
										companies sold. Options we saw included Aruba, Zebra, Moko Smart and many others.
										We considered GPS, however we knew this might not be feasible for hospitals with
										many floors especially in the basement for example, so it was decided that this
										would be a last option. We also considered using bluetooth and GPS in combination
										for more accurate tracking.
										<br>
										At this stage, we could already foresee problems arising. For example, a group member who
										had prior experience with bluetooth suggested that bluetooth may not be extremely accurate
										due signal interferences and obstacles blocking signal such as a phone case, and walls,
										particularly as many doors in hospitals are thick fire doors.
									</p>
									<p>
										We knew that we would likely have to implement a mobile app for porters and a website for
										administrators in the system. From discussing with Apian we knew that this was usually
										specific people who assigned tasks to porters but could also be doctors themselves.
										<br>
										From this we could tell that we needed to decide on a frontend framework, how to implement
										the app and how to store data in the backend. Hosting would also need to be handled.
										As we knew that we were using several different platforms (mobile and web) we immediately
										knew that React Native was a safe bet due to its performant and cross platform nature.
										Some of our members also had experience with React Native making it an excellent choice.
										After discussion we felt that React native would also be a viable option for the mobile app
										but soon realized the levels of permissions that would be needed would warrant an application
										and a webpage would not suffice.
										<br>
										Our client, Apian who had experience in the area also guided us to use create an Android app.
										We decided that the app would be best written in Kotlin.
