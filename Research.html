									<p>
										UBI Solutions is a French software company primarily focussed on providing asset
										tracking solutions. It creates a variety of solutions for corporations in the food
										industry, laundry, retail and more. Typically solutions revolve around using RFID
										tags and mobile or fixed readers. [1] However, other solutions are also used and the
										company's focus is providing an effective solution tailored to a client.
									</p>
									<p>
										In this review we will look at one solution, picked among many of the projects
										due to its similarity to the context of our own project. It was in part picked randomly
										from several similar projects, due to said projects also being similarly well documented
										with similar merits.
									</p>
									<p>
										UBI Solutions' Hospital Assets Tracking makes use of BLE tags and beacons to track
										assets such as bed sheets moving throughout the hospital. They work on a gateway system
										where BLE gateways track individual BLE tags throughout the hospital. BLE tags each have
										unique identifiers that they transmit. In addition to tracking, the tags are fitted with
										shock, temperature and humidity sensors where relevant to track the health of the asset.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>The main goals of the system are:</b><br>
										To free up staff time<br>
										Reducing loss of equipment due to theft<br>
										Reduce costs due to negligence<br>
										To reliably log asset usage data<br>
										Implement automatic preventative care of assets<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										The solution is effective, minimal and cost effective. It has a lot of the features
										that we would need for a hospital porter tracking system, where instead of assets we would
										track porters. It has some redundant features such as the sensors to detect health of the
										asset, however the overall principle is the same. It does however miss 1. a method to
										communicate to porters their tasks and 2. a method to decide which porters are optimal for
										tasks. Both features missing are quite essential and something we would have to explore
										ourselves.

									<h4>Navenio: Hospital Staff Tracking</h4>

									<p>
										Navenio is an Oxford based company focussed on increasing ROI of hospitals. They achieve
										this with their smartphone based location tracking and task assignment solution to assign tasks.
										They have utilize a mixture of IUD, GPS and wifi to accurately track staff locations. Further
										to this, they utilize a task assignment system and collect logistic data with some amount of
										automated processing to generate recommendations to increase efficiency.
									</p>
									<p>
										As mentioned, Navenio's solution utilizes IUD, GPS and wifi to accurately track staff location.
										They utilize PDR algorithms to adjust for ways a smartphone is held and deep learning based
										correction
										of inertia discrepancies due to positioning of the phone. They also make use of camera data where
										possible.GPD and wi-Fi is used to accurately detect when someone enters or exits the building.
										The system is interestingly capable of multiple floor location and tracking. Maps of the hospital
										are
										automatically built using historical tracking data of all the staff.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>The main goals of the system are:</b><br>
										To free up staff time<br>
										Optimal assignment of tasks<br>
										Provide a solution that has no dependency on installing infrastructure<br>
										To reliably log movement data for efficiency recommendations<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										The solution is effective, minimal and cost effective, installation wise. Development of the
										algorithms
										and potential problems may create heavy costs however. As the solution utilizes AI to accurately
										location
										track, extensive collection of phone movement data is required and will create heavy costs.

									<h3>Technology Review</h3>
									<img src="images/placeholder.png" alt="" />
									<p>
										Following the client meeting, we wrote up requirements, which can be seen in the requirements
										section of the portfolio blog. In an attempt to try and refine our requirements further
										we conducted market research. Having set up the relevant communication channels with
										Apian such as Slack, WhatsApp and Email, we tried to confirm a tech stack with our client.
										This involved investigating the pricings, discussing budgets and caveats with different
										technologies and their competitors.
									<p>
										Knowing our client was working on a small budget, being a startup, we took a greater
										focus on budget options for Bluetooth tracking and communication. For instance, we asked
										the Computer Science help desk what BLE tracking devices they had available to help
										direct our choices. Furthermore, we explored funding options from UCL, discussing and
										writing emails to ask what UCL would be willing to fund. For example if UCL could fund a
										premium firebase subscription.
									</p>
									<p>
										The potential tracking options we considered were, low power BLE beacons which many
										companies sold. Options we saw included Aruba, Zebra, Moko Smart and many others.
										We considered GPS, however we knew this might not be feasible for hospitals with
										many floors especially in the basement for example, so it was decided that this
										would be a last option. We also considered using bluetooth and GPS in combination
										for more accurate tracking.
										<br>
										At this stage, we could already foresee problems arising. For example, a group member who
										had prior experience with bluetooth suggested that bluetooth may not be extremely accurate
										due signal interferences and obstacles blocking signal such as a phone case, and walls,
										particularly as many doors in hospitals are thick fire doors.
									</p>
									<p>
										We knew that we would likely have to implement a mobile app for porters and a website for
										administrators in the system. From discussing with Apian we knew that this was usually
										specific people who assigned tasks to porters but could also be doctors themselves.
										<br>
										From this we could tell that we needed to decide on a frontend framework, how to implement
										the app and how to store data in the backend. Hosting would also need to be handled.
										As we knew that we were using several different platforms (mobile and web) we immediately
										knew that React Native was a safe bet due to its performant and cross platform nature.
										Some of our members also had experience with React Native making it an excellent choice.
										After discussion we felt that React native would also be a viable option for the mobile app
										but soon realized the levels of permissions that would be needed would warrant an application
										and a webpage would not suffice.
										<br>
										Our client, Apian who had experience in the area also guided us to use create an Android app.
										We decided that the app would be best written in Kotlin.
