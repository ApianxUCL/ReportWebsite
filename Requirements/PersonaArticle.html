								Amanda is a member of NHS staff at Guy's Hospital. Her job as a porter is to load up drones with medical packages in response to requests sent to her by laboratory staff. 
                                She is unhappy with the current system at the hospital as, whenever there is a parcel to be delivered, all porters are notified, regardless of their location in the hospital. This, as described by her, is an inefficient and tiring process as there is no reason to notify every porter to make a delivery when the porters could be easily located, and the request should be sent to the nearest one to the package. Amanda is a person that tries to continually make improvements to her methods of work, in order to make them more efficient and save herself the extra time and effort. She is eager to see her co-workers do the same as she feels it will make them happier and improve the overall atmosphere at the hospital and hence, working conditions. She has noted that she is not much of a leader, which means that it is unlikely she would speak up about this issue, so she really appreciated us taking into consideration her thoughts when designing our prototypes for the new application. 
                                Finally, she also feels that a new system would be beneficial to everyone at the hospital as it will be easier to use than the old, outdated technologies currently in use.​​
