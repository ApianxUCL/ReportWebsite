										Overall, we are delighted with the product we had the opportunity to build. It is an honour for the team that
										our project has been demonstrated to porters at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and will hopefully
										be the foundation for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7042105812785254400/">a new system of pharmaceutical transportation.</a>

									<h3>Evaluation</h3>
									<p>
										<h3>User Interface</h3>
										It's important to mention that our project consists of two parts, an Android Application that scans
										for BLE devices and a Web ApplicationThroughout the development of our project, we made sure to keep in
										mind that our users are medical staffs. This means that the UI/UX and workflow of the
										overall system must be clear and straightforward. In order to achieve this, we kept close contact with
										our client and ask them for feedback after every design
										iteration. The client even helped us out by providing direct feedback with their respective UI/UX
										employee. Some key UI/UX design we've evaluated: </p>
						
						
										<ul>
											<li>The main page of the web app is the Live Monitoring Page. This is where medical staff
												dispatchers would most likely spend a lot of the time seeing. We made
												sure to color code the porters on the map based on their availability. Moreover, on the table to
												the right of the map, we clearly show the availability status of porters
												by color coding the cell.
											</li>
											<li>The delivery request function is also located on the Live Monitoring Page since it would make
												sense for users to see who are available or not and making a request based on that. </li>
											<li>With regards to navigating to other pages, it doesn't get simpler as using a classic navigation
												bar and highlighting the page the user is seeing at present. If users want to see
												delivery history made in the past by porters they may navigate to
											</li>
											<li>
												With respect to our Android Application, the app is meant to be used by porters walking around
												the hospitals in order for medical staff to track them with the use of beacons placed around
												hospitals.
												Hence, the app is really simple with clear design and instruction for porters. Porters can
												either accept or decline a request made by the medical staff on the app. The option to accept or
												decline is really clear
												due to the color and the size of the button.
						
						
											</li>
										</ul>
						
						
						
										<h3>Functionalities</h3>
										<p>
						
											We've always prioritise the client's requirement of this project. All the "Must Have" that are
											required, we've succesfully finished and implemented.
											here are some of them:
										<ul>
											<li>
												Create a bluetooth scanning Anroid app that scans for beacons and if it comes close to a beacon
												it then sends the MAC address to our web app.
											</li>
											<li>
												Live monitor porters through the use of the Android App and beacons placed around the hospital.
											</li>
											<li>
												Create a working web app which has the following functionalities: Live Monitoring, Delivery
												Logs, Send Requests to porters.
											</li>
						
										</ul>
										In terms of tracking porters, we ran into a bit of trouble due to the beacon's signal strength. Tracking
										porters with 100% accuracy would most likely need
										multiple beacons surrounding the area at all times for the app to scan it successfully and sends the MAC
										Address back to our web app. This is called triangluation where we use the distance and signal strength
										provided by the three closest beacons to the porter in order to accurately locate where the porter is.
										We wrote the algorithm for this and proposed it to our client. Due to privacy reasons, said by the
										client, we had to scratch it and proposed
										a much simple solution. The current solution is to place more beacons around the pick-up/delivery area
										so we are still able to keep track of which porters are closest and available for a delivery.
						
						
										</p>
						
										<h3>Stability-Efficiency</h3>
										<p>
											Our delivery request system works perfectly. Once a medical staff disptacher sends a request to a
											porter through our web app, the porter receives it instantly with the option for them to accept or
											decline.
											The Android App is also stable and runs without any issue in the background which we are very
											pleased about.
						
											The only inefficiency we have in our system would probably be the live monitoring in which we aren't
											able to track with 100% accuracy where the porters are at all times. We went with a solution which
											our client is satisfied with and would work fine.
						
						
						
										</p>
						
										<h3>Compatibility</h3>
										<p>
											Our Android App is available for download using the APK. You may download the file through our
											public Website : https://porterble-ui-c29ff.web.app/appInstructions .
											Moreover, our web app is hosted publicly and everyone is able to access it through the link above.
						
										</p>
						
										<h3>Maintainability</h3>
										<p>
											With careful design and planning before actually writing code, we were able to avoid "dead code",
											bugs, and other vulenerabilities. Our code is well documented and every step of the way we would
											do code reviews with the team so everyone will know what's going on. Our project is easily enhanced
											and it doesn't require massive changes on all parts in order to update a feature. For example, we
											created an initial floor plan before
											receiving the final hospital floor plan and we placed markers and beacons on it. Once we've received
											the final floor plan from our client we were able to change the floorplan with all the
											functionalities working perfectly fine.
						
						
										</p>
										<h3>Project Management</h3>
										<p>
											At the start of this project, our project management wasn't exactly the best. After a couple of
											meetings between the client and our team, we finally were able
											to get a grasp and created a gantt chart with all the requirements. We also initialized a github org
											for the client to see our progress. We then divide and conquered all the tasks we needed to do every
											month and dsitributed
											it equally amongst ourselves. With weekly code reviews and client meeting, we were always on top of
											this project and always continued making improvments.

									<h3>Future Work</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>Completely automate delivery request system without the need of a staff to manually create a
											request</li>
										<li>Emergency request. Be able to override current request so porters can now prioritise emergency
											request.</li>
										<li>More accurate live monitoring of porters. This may only be achieved if and only if privacy
											measures have been considerend. </li>
