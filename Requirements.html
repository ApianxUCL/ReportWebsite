									<h3>Project Background and Partner</h3>
									<a href="https://apian.aero/" class="image fit"><img src="images/Apian Resources/Apian Design Crop.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Our client, <a href="https://apian.aero/">Apian</a>, is a medical drone start-up that partners with the NHS to connect the healthcare industry with the drone industry to improve patient health outcomes and staff well-being. 
										Apian has asked us to work together with them and start a project which we call PorterBLE. 
										The PorterBLE system consists of a web app and an android application.
										The Android Application is for medical porters to use.
										The purpose of the application is for tracking their location within the hospital. 
										Once a porter with their smartphone comes close to a beacon placed in the hospital, the app will send the MAC Address of that beacon to our web appâ€™s backend for us to display their live location.
										The web app is made for medical dispatchers for them to monitor the availability, location, and create a delivery request for porters who are available and closest to the pick-up location
									</p>

									<h3>Project Goals</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Succesfully live monitor medical porters with the use of our system </li>
										<li>Send delivery request to porters who are available and closest to pick-up location</li>
										<li>Working Android App which scans for beacons placed in a hospital</li>
										
										
									</ul>

									<h3>Requirement Gathering</h3>
									<p>
										We gathered all of our requirements by working very closely with our client. We created a WhatsApp Groupchat with our client as well as 
										a shared Google Document where we post all of our initial questions about the project. Our client will answer 
										all of our questions very promptly and help us navigate through different possible solutions. Here's some snippets of the shared GoogleDoc: 
					
									</p>
									<img src="images/GoogleDoc.png" width=50% alt="" />
									<p>
										After receiving an answer from our client to our questions, we would discuss as a team how we may move forward and
										evaluating each requirements. Once we all agree to a requirement then we would include it in our requirements list.

									<h3>Personas</h3>
									<h4>Amanda</h4>
									<img src="images/Persona1.png" alt="" />
									<p>
										Amanda is a member of NHS staff at Guy's Hospital. Her job as a porter is to load up drones with
										medical packages in response to requests sent to her by laboratory staff.
										She is unhappy with the current system at the hospital as, whenever there is a parcel to be
										delivered, all porters are notified, regardless of their location in the hospital. This, as
										described by her, is an inefficient and tiring process as there is no reason to notify every porter
										to make a delivery when the porters could be easily located, and the request should be sent to the
										nearest one to the package. Amanda is a person that tries to continually make improvements to her
										methods of work, in order to make them more efficient and save herself the extra time and effort.
										She is eager to see her co-workers do the same as she feels it will make them happier and improve
										the overall atmosphere at the hospital and hence, working conditions. She has noted that she is not
										much of a leader, which means that it is unlikely she would speak up about this issue, so she really
										appreciated us taking into consideration her thoughts when designing our prototypes for the new
										application.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, she also feels that a new system would be beneficial to everyone at the hospital as it will
										be easier to use than the old, outdated technologies currently in use.â€‹â€‹
									</p>
									<h4>David</h4>
									<img src="images/Persona2.png" alt="" />
									<p>
										David is the manager of the Computer-Aided Facilities (CAD) department at St. Thomas's hospital.
										Like Amanda, he is also a potential user of our system, however, he has a different opinion on
										the system currently in use for the drone delivery of pharmaceuticals. He believes that the
										current system in use is somewhat satisfactory as the hospital drones can keep up with the
										delivery requests with only a few delays in delivery. He would rather not study a new system,
										where he would have to memorize another set of usernames and passwords on top of the ones he
										already has to remember. David, though, wants to keep all his employees happy, so if there was
										no other option left by his employees, he would be willing to change his mind and understands
										the potential benefits and improvements that our proposed solution would provide. David also
										describes himself as a person of high leadership and confidence so it is understandable that he
										would want a system that he can study and be in complete control of which would allow him to
										guide his staff whenever an issue arises.
									</p>
									<p>
										In general, he would like a system that efficiently deals with the priority-scheduling of the
										delivery of packages, allows users to view where porters are located and is relatively simple to
										use. â€‹â€‹
