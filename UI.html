				<h3>Client Requirements</h3>
				<p>
					Upon consultation with our client, we identified the crucial requirements for our web design project
					in a hospital setting.
					As a result, we embarked on sketching our initial design, primarily using hand-drawn techniques on a
					tablet.<br /><br />
					Our first sketch was crucial to us, as it had to incorporate a number of client-identified key
					features including:
				<ul>
					<b>The ability for medical staff dispatchers to:</b>
					<li>Track the live location of porters</li>
					<li>View the availability of porters</li>
					<li>Send delivery requests to available porters based on factors like:
						<ul>
							<li>Their proximity to the pick-up point</li>
							<li>Their availability</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<section id="initial-sketches">
					<h3>Initial Sketches</h3>

					<p>
						In our first sketch, usability and simplicity were our main priorities, so that hospital staff
						do not experience any difficulties
						when it comes to navigating our website. As a result, we designed a home page that features a
						navigation bar to allow users to switch between the live monitoring and
						delivery details page effortlessly.<br />
						The live monitoring page comprises markers for porters, displaying their availability on the
						side. We have also incorporated a feature that enables
						users to sort the porters by distance, ensuring that the nearest porter is assigned to a
						particular delivery request. Clicking on an available
						porter sends the user to the delivery request page.<br />
						The delivery details page features a comprehensive history of on-going deliveries, allowing the
						medical staff to monitor which porters are delivering
						which supplies.<br /><br />
						Our second sketch is an improvement of the first, with subtle changes to enhance usability. We
						have added a view option in the live monitoring page,
						enabling users to see different parts of the hospital. We have also created a table on the
						delivery request page, which promotes organization and ease
						of access.<br />
						The sketches seen above are preliminary designs, created for the purpose of comparison before
						proceeding to the interface design stage using Figma.
						As mentioned previously, our sketches ensured that the final design is user-friendly, intuitive,
						and efficient for medical staff in a hospital setting,
						so that deliveries can be fulfilled as quickly as possible.

					<h3>Figma Prototyping</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="images/Apian_Figma_1.png" width="420" alt="" style="float: left;" />
						<img src="images/Apian_Figma_2.png" width="420" alt="" style="margin: 0px 10px 20px 30px;" />
						<img src="images/Apian_Figma_3.png" width="420" alt="" style="float: left;" />
						<img src="images/Apian_Figma_4.png" width="420" alt="" style="margin: 0px 10px 20px 30px;" />
						<img src="images/Apian_Figma_5.png" width="420" alt="" style="float: left;" />
						<img src="images/Apian_Figma_6.png" width="420" alt="" style="margin: 0px 10px 20px 30px;" />
						<img src="images/Apian_Figma_7.png" width="420" class="center" />
					<p>
						After an internal meeting with our team, we decided to choose the best components from the
						previous two sketches and decided to create a design on Figma. This is to show our client and
						for them to provide concrete feedback. As per the requirement this sketch includes all the
						important ones such as live monitoring, delivery requests, and delivery history.
						We also paid attention to detail such as coloring and made the theme similar to the Apian Logo.
					</p>
					</p>
					<h3>Figma Iterations</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="images/Apian_Figma_Feedback_1.png" width="420" alt="" style="float: left;" />
						<img src="images/Apian_Figma_Feedback_2.png" width="420" alt=""
							style="margin: 0px 10px 20px 30px;" />


						Our client’s UI/UX specialist gave us feedback after showing them the first Figma design. And
						she helped us give concrete feedback. Here are some of the feedback she gave us:
					<ul>
						<li>“Use a different font size/thickness for the display options. The navigational menu should
							be different from the rest of the page.”</li>
						<li>“Dropdown + Sort by components aren't that obvious. I would use the Bootstrap UI icons."
						</li>
						<li>"Try showing the user which page is active in a different way. It's not very obvious and
							looks like you've just changed the colour for fun."</li>
					</ul>


					We considered all the feedback she gave us and we made slight changes to the previous design.

						<img src="images/Apian_CurrentWeb_5.png" width="420" alt="" class="center" />
					<p>After multiple iterations of designs, we finally started coding our website based on the UI/UX
						design we made. At this point, we realized we haven’t yet considered a couple of things such as
						adding the option for users to specify a pick-up/delivery location and beacons on the map. There
						were quite a few design changes from our Figma designs. For example, for the porter table on the
						Live Monitoring page, not only do we have the Porter name but we also added status, last
						updated, the option to make a porter available or unavailable, and the ability to delete a
						porter.
						Most of these additional features were added after going back and forth with our client. </p>

					<h3>Final Website</h3>

						<img src="images/Apian_FinalWeb_4.png" width="420" alt="" style="margin: 0px 10px 20px 30px;" />
						<img src="images/Apian_FinalWeb_5.png" width="420" alt="" class="center" />
					<p>Finally we are proud to say that we have finalized our UI/UX for our web app. There are a couple
						of changes such as the floor plan. The floor plan displayed
						is actually the actual hospital floor plan in which we are going to deploy our project in. We
						made the design a lot cleaner than the previous design and we made sure
						to highlight important actions with bright or dark colors. </p>
