					<h4>Testing Strategy</h4>
					<p>
						Testing is a crucial part of the software development process that ensures the quality and
						reliability
						of an application. In our project, we used a combination of unit, integration,
						and user acceptance testing
						to ensure that our application met the requirements and delivered a seamless user experience.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="unit-testing">
					<h4>Unit Testing</h4>
					<p>
						Unit testing is an essential part of our software development process. We utilize unit testing
						to ensure that individual units of our code, such as methods and functions, function as expected
						and meet the requirements. We use JUnit as our primary unit testing tool for our backend
						services, and Jest for our frontend components.
					</p>
					<p>
						JUnit is a popular Java testing framework that is widely used for unit testing. It provides a
						simple
						and
						efficient way to test individual units of code, such as methods and functions, in isolation from
						the
						rest of the application. We used JUnit to test the individual components of our backend service,
						such as
						controllers, services, and repositories, to ensure they functioned correctly and met the
						requirements.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to backend testing, we also performed frontend testing using Jest. Jest is a popular
						testing framework for React
						applications
						that provides a simple and efficient way to test individual components in isolation. We used
						Jest to
						test individual components' functionality, such as rendering and event handling, and ensure they
						functioned as expected.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="integration-testing">
					<h4>Integration Testing</h4>
					<p>
						Integration testing is another critical component of our software development process. We use
						integration testing to verify that different components of our application, such as the backend
						and
						frontend, work together correctly and meet the requirements. We use MockMVC and React Testing
						Library as our primary integration testing tools.
					</p>
					<p>
						MockMVC is a powerful testing framework that is used to test the integration of controllers with
						the
						rest of the application. We utilized MockMVC to simulate requests to our application's API
						endpoints
						and
						verify the response from the backend. This helped us to test the integration of our backend
						components.
					</p>
					<p>
						React Testing Library, on the other hand, allowed us to test the integration of our frontend
						components
						with the rest of the application. We used it to simulate user interactions and verify the
						response
						from
						the backend service. This helped us to ensure that our application's frontend components
						functioned
						correctly and provided a seamless user experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						We conduct integration testing by creating test cases that simulate the flow of data and
						interactions between different components of our application. We then run these test cases using
						our
						testing tool to verify that the actual output and behavior of our application match the expected
						output and behavior.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="manual-testing">
					<h4>Manual Testing</h4>
					<p>
						Manual testing was also an essential part of our testing process. We conducted manual tests to
						verify
						the application's functionality and ensure that it met the requirements. This included testing
						the application's user interface, functionality, and usability to ensure that it was intuitive
						and
						easy to use.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="user-testing">
					<h4>User Acceptance Testing</h4>

					<p>
						During the testing phase, we invited porters from the hospital to use our application and
						provide
						us valuable first-hand feedback. This feedback was crucial in identifying any usability issues
						and
						making necessary improvements to the application. We observed the porters as they used the
						application,
						noting any issues they encountered or features they found confusing.
					</p>

					<p>
						We also conducted feedback sessions with the porters to gather their thoughts on the
						application's
						functionality, usability, and overall experience. This feedback allowed us to make necessary
						changes
						to the application and ensure that it met the porters' needs and requirements.
					</p>

					<p>
						Involving the porters in the testing process was a valuable step in ensuring that our
						application
						provided a high-quality user experience and met the needs of its users. Their feedback allowed
						us to
						identify and address any issues before the application was deployed, ensuring that it was fully
						functional and user-friendly.
					</p>

					<p>
						In conclusion, testing is an essential part of the software development process, and it ensures
						the
						quality and reliability of an application. We used a combination of testing tools and
						methodologies,
						including JUnit, MockMVC, Jest, React Testing Library, manual testing, and user testing, to
						ensure
						that our application met the requirements and delivered a seamless user experience. By testing
						our
						application thoroughly, we were able to identify and fix issues early in the development process
						and
						ensure that our application provided a high-quality user experience.
