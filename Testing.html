									<h3>Testing Strategy</h3>
									<p>
										Testing is a crucial part of the software development process that ensures the quality and
										reliability
										of an application. In our project, we used a combination of unit, integration,
										and user acceptance testing
										to ensure that our application met the requirements and delivered a seamless user experience.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section id="unit-testing">
									<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
									<p>
										Unit testing is an essential part of our software development process. We utilize unit testing
										to ensure that individual units of our code, such as methods and functions, function as expected
										and meet the requirements.
									</p>
										<h4>Web Application</h4>
										<p>
											We used <b>JUnit</b> as our primary unit testing tool for our backend services, and <b>Jest</b> for our frontend components.
										</p>
										<p>
											JUnit is a popular Java testing framework that is widely used for unit testing. It provides a
											simple
											and
											efficient way to test individual units of code, such as methods and functions, in isolation from
											the
											rest of the application. We used JUnit to test the individual components of our backend service,
											such as
											controllers, services, and repositories, to ensure they functioned correctly and met the
											requirements.
										</p>
										<p>
											In addition to backend testing, we also performed frontend testing using Jest. Jest is a popular
											testing framework for React
											applications
											that provides a simple and efficient way to test individual components in isolation. We used
											Jest to
											test individual components' functionality, such as rendering and event handling, and ensure they
											functioned as expected.
										</p>
										<h4>Mobile Application</h4>
										<p>
											To unit test our Android application, we made use of ...

									<h3>Integration Testing</h3>
									<p>
										Integration testing is another critical component of our software development process. We use
										integration testing to verify that different components of our application, such as the backend
										and
										frontend, work together correctly and meet the requirements. We use MockMVC and React Testing
										Library as our primary integration testing tools.
									</p>
									<p>
										MockMVC is a powerful testing framework that is used to test the integration of controllers with
										the
										rest of the application. We utilized MockMVC to simulate requests to our application's API
										endpoints
										and
										verify the response from the backend. This helped us to test the integration of our backend
										components.
									</p>
									<p>
										React Testing Library, on the other hand, allowed us to test the integration of our frontend
										components
										with the rest of the application. We used it to simulate user interactions and verify the
										response
										from
										the backend service. This helped us to ensure that our application's frontend components
										functioned
										correctly and provided a seamless user experience.
									</p>
									<p>
										We conduct integration testing by creating test cases that simulate the flow of data and
										interactions between different components of our application. We then run these test cases using
										our
										testing tool to verify that the actual output and behavior of our application match the expected
										output and behavior.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section id="manual-testing">
									<h3>Manual Testing</h3>
									<p>
										Manual testing was also an essential part of our testing process. We conducted manual tests to
										verify
										the application's functionality and ensure that it met the requirements. This included testing
										the application's user interface, functionality, and usability to ensure that it was intuitive
										and
										easy to use.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section id="user-testing">
									<h3>User Acceptance Testing</h3>
				
									<p>
										During the testing phase, we invited porters from the hospital to use our application and
										provide
										us valuable first-hand feedback. This feedback was crucial in identifying any usability issues
										and
										making necessary improvements to the application. We observed the porters as they used the
										application,
										noting any issues they encountered or features they found confusing.
									</p>
				
									<p>
										We also conducted feedback sessions with the porters to gather their thoughts on the
										application's
										functionality, usability, and overall experience. This feedback allowed us to make necessary
										changes
										to the application and ensure that it met the porters' needs and requirements.
									</p>
				
									<p>
										Involving the porters in the testing process was a valuable step in ensuring that our
										application
										provided a high-quality user experience and met the needs of its users. Their feedback allowed
										us to
										identify and address any issues before the application was deployed, ensuring that it was fully
										functional and user-friendly.
									</p>
				
									<p>
										In conclusion, testing is an essential part of the software development process, and it ensures
										the
										quality and reliability of an application. We used a combination of testing tools and
										methodologies,
										including JUnit, MockMVC, Jest, React Testing Library, manual testing, and user testing, to
										ensure
										that our application met the requirements and delivered a seamless user experience. By testing
										our
										application thoroughly, we were able to identify and fix issues early in the development process
										and
										ensure that our application provided a high-quality user experience.
